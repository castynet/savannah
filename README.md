**What the app does;**
The app is suppoed to help teachers schedule lessons and prepare the timetable

**My Implementation;**
On Launching the app, you go to a login page (if you are not logged in already), the app logs you in via Google, asking for the permission to your calendar...
The app then looks for the Timetable calendar and creates it if it does not exist, if it exists it is opened and the user is taken to a second page which displays the timetable.
From there the user can then toggle between viewing the timetable and creating new lessons.
Delightfully the app uses ReactJS
